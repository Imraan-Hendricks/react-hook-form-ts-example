# react-hook-form-ts-example

This project serves as an example of how to use react-hook-form with typescript. This project includes a form where users can enter some basic information and submit it. On submit, the form data will be displayed back to the user. This data is commonly used when making a request to your server.

The on change, submission and validation of the form will be handled by react-hook-form's register, handleSubmit and errors functionality, respectively. A custom callback function gets passed to handleSubmit where the resulting form data can be managed.
